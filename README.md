**AirBnB clone project**

**Project Description:**
This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

**Command Interpreter Description:**
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell.

**How to start it:**
I coded the project under instructions then running on my local machine for development and testing purposes.

**How to use it:**
My shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$

and in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
